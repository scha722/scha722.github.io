## About Me
Hi! I'm a student interested in biostatistics, machine learning and optimization.

My domain of interest is mainly in the application of AI and data analysis in medical/biological data to provide accessible and personalized medical services. 

In 2023 I worked at ForeTellMyHealth, a startup company aiming to create an applicable predictive model for early-stage ovarian cancer. My work largely focused on prospective biomarker discovery for ovarian cancer using the gene expression dataset. Through analyses of past research on ovarian cancer and heat map/LDA dimension reduction techniques, I have visualized the discrimination powers of individuals or the combination of dozens to hundreds of biomarkers. With the insight that I have gathered, I further worked on developing an anomaly-detecting model, specifically the f-AnoGAN. f-AnoGAN is a GAN-based anomaly detection model that discriminates any images that the discriminator sees as non-genuine. 

In 2024, my research focuses on utilizing K-Means clustering to find optimal vertiport locations for eVTOLs(electric vertical takeoff and Landing). Our work revolves around implementing the current framework to a variety of case studies such as EMS (Emergency Medical Services), leisure activity, and logistics. My role is largely on developing a modified K-Means algorithm from scratch that is suitable for our specific problem and designing specific scenarios for EMS case studies such that the implementation of eVTOL would be beneficial. This research was published in **AIAA SciTech 2025**.
